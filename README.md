# Competition description (Kaggle)

"Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home."

# Required software tools
Python 3, jupyter notebook, pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, and seaborn.
